# AZ Tank Clone

---

> What is AZ?
>
> Physics, a maze, and competition combine together all in one package to make AZ,  a fun and challenging tank game that will keep you consumed for hours at a time.
>
> Once you’re in, you’ll notice a maze with your tank and the enemy tank. If you’re playing with other players, their tanks will spawn in too. The game is simple: use the directional buttons to move your tank forward, backward, left, and right, then use the fire button to fire off your shots. Keep in mind, you can only shoot a finite amount of projectiles at a time, so focus on improving your aim.
> 
> Tips For AZ
>
>     Get used to the art of the ricochet. Your projectiles can bounce around the different walls and catch your opponent off guard.
>     Be careful not to shoot yourself. If you’re unlucky, one of your projectiles can bounce back and take you out.
>     Keep moving! Don’t stay in one place too long or else you may get caught by a stray projectile.
>
> Have fun!
